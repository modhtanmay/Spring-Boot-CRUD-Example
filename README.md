# Spring-Boot-CRUD-Example
In this Project, 
1. I have developed a Java web application that manages information in a database – with standard CRUD operations: 
Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. 
2. Further adding and implementing filter/search functionality.

# Technologies Used:

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) : Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring 
Framework. It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.It is a Spring module that provides the 
RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework.Spring MVC: simplifies coding the controller layer. No more boilerplate code of Java Servlet classes.<br>

[Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa): Simplifies coding the data access layer. No more boilerplate code of DAO classes.<br>

[Hibernate](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3373652/java-persistence-with-jpa-and-hibernate-part-1-entities-and-relationships.html): is used as an ORM framework – implementation of JPA. No more boilerplate JDBC code.<br>

[ThymeLeaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/): simplifies coding the view layer. No more cluttered JSP and JSTL tags.<br>

[MySql](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) : MySQL Workbench is a visual database design tool that integrates SQL 
development, administration, database design, creation and maintenance into a single integrated development environment for the 
MySQL database system.
